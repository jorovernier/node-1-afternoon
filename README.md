# Project Summary

In this project we're going to build the backend service (API) for an ecommerce site. We'll be able to display products, search for products, and retrieve a specific product. There will be some accelerator content at the end to help add additional challenges.

The goal is to better understand how the client (frontend application) and server (backend application) interact with each other in the `request -> response cycle`. This includes generating a request on the client, receiving and parsing it on the server, and sending the response back to the client.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your `fork`.

## Step 1

### Summary

We're starting from a clean slate. We'll be building our backend service from start to finish. Often, you'll have some boilerplate code to start with. `Boilerplate` is a term that describes starter or framework code. For instance, create-react-app generates boiler plate code for us, things like our `package.json`, `node_modules`, the `src` directory, etc. Here we won't have any of that so we'll need to create it ourselves.

### Instructions

* Start this project by running `npm init -y`
    * Review the `package.json` that was created
    * We'll now be able to utilize packages from the NPM store
* Create a new directory called `server`
    * Inside server create an `index.js`
    * This is where we'll architect our server

## Step 2

### Summary

Now that we have our foundation set up, let's start building out our ecommerce API. In this step, we'll setup and test the initial framework for our server.

### Instructions

* Start by installing Express
    * `npm install express`
* Next, build the skeleton of your server
    * This should include:
        * Requiring express
        * Declaring your `app` variable and setting it equal to express invoked
        * Declaring the port you want your server to `listen` on.
        * Invoking `app.listen`:
            * Provide it the port variable from above
            * And a callback with a console log so we know our server is running and ready to receive requests.
        * Finally, go to your terminal/git bash.
            * Type `pwd` to make sure you're in the root directory
                * It should look something like this `/Users/yourname/DevMountain/node/node-1`
                * If you're not, navigate back to the root of the project directory.
            * From there, run the following command `nodemon server/index.js`
            * You should see the `console.log` message from your `listen` method in the console.

    <summary><code> server/index.js </code></summary>
    ```js
    const express = require('express');

    const app = express();

    const port = 3001;

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server listening on port: ${port}`);
    });
    ```
    </details>

## Step 3

### Summary

Now that we know our server is able to receive requests, let's get started adding our first endpoint and sending our first piece of data. The data we'll be using is provided for you in the `root` directory called `products.json`.

### Instructions

* Open `server/index.js`
* Require the `products.json` file and store it to a variable called `products`
* Write an endpoint that will send our array of products up to the client (note: make sure to do this below our `app` declaration)
    * An endpoint consists of a `Method`, `Path`, and `Handler`
    * The method for this endpoint should be a `GET` request
    * The path should be `/api/products`
    * The handler should be a function that accepts `req` and `res` as parameters and sends our `products` back to the client with a status of `200`
* Check your console to make sure your server is still running
* Open your browser and type `http://localhost:[your-port]/api/products`
    * You should see your array of products printed to the browser
    <details>
    <summary><code> server/index.js </code></summary>
    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const products = require('../products.json');

    const app = express();

    const port = 3001;

    app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
        res.status(200).send(products)
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server listening on port: ${port}`);
    });
    ```
    </details>


## Step 4

### Summary

In this step, we'll make a small adjustment to our `index.js`. A couple of aspects that are important to development are organization and clarity. You can see that as we start to add more and more endpoints our index file will quickly become cluttered. In this step we'll refactor (change) our index file so that all of our business logic (the Handlers for our endpoints) are contained in their own files.

### Instructions

* Create a new file in `./server` called `getProducts.js`
* Copy the handler from our endpoint into the `getProducts` file
* Store it to a variable called `getProducts`
* Export the function
    * Remember, in node we use `module.exports`
* Require the file into `index.js` as a variable called `getProducts`
* Replace the Handler with our `getProducts` function
    * Remember, any function that's used on an express method (represented as `app`) will receive `req` and `res` by default.
* Test it in the browser like the previous step
